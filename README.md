# Chord Practice

This web applications allows people learning guitar to practice and track progress
of chord switching. While learning guitar, it is important to exercise your muscle
memory by switching between chords. This app tracks a user's known chords (from
a library of them) and will run chord switching practice sessions, tracking the number
of switches the guitarist can make in one minute. Each session consists of practicing
switches between a configurable number of chord pairs for a configurable duration.
Statistics over time are kept and can be graphed to track progress.
