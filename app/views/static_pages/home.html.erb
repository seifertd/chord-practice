        <p>Perhaps the best technique to improve your guitar playing is to develop clean, crisp and speedy chord changes.
          The best way to do this is by using the "1 minute switch" technique.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">The concept is simple: time yourself for one minute and see how many changes between two chords you can do in that time. This works better than any other method I have ever heard of for developing your chord change skills. It's really quite astounding how well this trick works.</blockquote>
