            <p>Perhaps the best technique to improve your guitar playing is to develop clean, crisp and speedy chord changes.
            The best way to do this is by using the "1 minute switch" technique.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">The concept is simple: time yourself for one minute and see how many changes between two chords you can do in that time. This works better than any other method I have ever heard of for developing your chord change skills. It's really quite astounding how well this trick works.</blockquote>

              <ul>
                <li>Keep track of the chords you know</li>
                <li>Set up practices of any duration to run switches between random chords you know</li>
                <li>Track the results of your practices and help you chart your progress over time</li>
              </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">How it works</h2>
            <p>
            Use the <a href="/chords">Chords</a> section to track the chords you have learned. Then use the
            <a href="/sessions">Practice</a> section to start chord switch practice sessions. Finally, track
            your progess using the <a href="/progress">Progress</a> section of the site.
